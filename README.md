Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation and Station Analysis
* The notebook for this data can be found at [sqlalchemy-challenge/climate_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/climate_analysis.ipynb)
* The graph images can be found in the [sqlalchemy-challenge/Images](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/tree/main/Images) folder.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Now that you have completed your initial analysis, design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
* The flask app can be found at [sqlalchemy-challenge/climate_app.py](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/climate_app.py)

## Bonus Temperature Analysis 1
Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year. Is there a meaningful difference between the temperature in, for example, June and December?
* The analysis file for this bonus task can be found at [sqlalchemy-challenge/temp_analysis_bonus_1.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/temp_analysis_bonus_1.ipynb)

## Bonus Temperature Analysis 2
You are looking to take a trip from August first to August seventh of this year, but are worried that the weather will be less than ideal. Using historical data in the dataset find out what the temperature has previously looked like.
* The analysis file for this bonus task can be found at [sqlalchemy-challenge/temp_analaysis_bonus_2.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/blob/main/temp_analysis_bonus_2.ipynb)
* The graph images can be found in the [sqlalchemy-challenge/Images](https://github.com/sarahcasauria/sqlalchemy-challenge/tree/main/Images) folder.
